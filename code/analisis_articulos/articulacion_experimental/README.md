* [Experiments execution and Design of Framework](http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/40658/10/10_chapter%205.pdf)

This is an experiment based research, this chapter elaborates experimental design, details of experiment performed on network data. This chapter elaborates experimentation performed for intrusion detection followed by analysis. Further, results are analyzed on the basis of performance measurement terms like correctly classified instances, true positive rate, false positive rate etc. and finally give details about designs of framework for detection of intrusion attack to strengthen computer network security 

Experiment design 

* The specific questions that the experiment is intended to answer must be clearly identified before carrying out the experiment
* Primary objective 
* Experiments are performed using following design strategy. Ex
  1. Selection of dataset.
  2. Recognize types of intrusion attack and their specification.
  3. Applying appropriate data preprocessing techniques.
  4. Applying appropriate classification technique.
  5. Performance measurement terms for evaluation of classifier performance.
  6. Choosing best classifier to build model for intrusion detection.
