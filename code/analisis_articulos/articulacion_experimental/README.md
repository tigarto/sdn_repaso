## [Experiments execution and Design of Framework](http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/40658/10/10_chapter%205.pdf) ##

This is an experiment based research, this chapter elaborates experimental design, details of experiment performed on network data. This chapter elaborates experimentation performed for intrusion detection followed by analysis. Further, results are analyzed on the basis of performance measurement terms like correctly classified instances, true positive rate, false positive rate etc. and finally give details about designs of framework for detection of intrusion attack to strengthen computer network security 

Experiment design 

* The specific questions that the experiment is intended to answer must be clearly identified before carrying out the experiment
* Primary objective 
* Experiments are performed using following design strategy. Ex
  1. Selection of dataset.
  2. Recognize types of intrusion attack and their specification.
  3. Applying appropriate data preprocessing techniques.
  4. Applying appropriate classification technique.
  5. Performance measurement terms for evaluation of classifier performance.
  6. Choosing best classifier to build model for intrusion detection.

## [DDoS Experiment Methodology](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.134.7224&rep=rep1&type=pdf) ##
  
Evaluation methodology using a combination of simulation, emulation, modeling, and analysis techniques that allows independent comparison of different DDoS defense systems.

5 high-level dimensions that the experimenter needs to carefully design in order to conduct an effective evaluation:
1. Attack mechanism.
2. Background traffic.
3. Network topology.
4. Defense mechanism.
5. Measurements and metrics. 

### Measurements and metrics ###
* Tipos de metricas:
  * extrinsic: are measures that can be computed and observed by external parties in relation to the object (attack, defense etc.) being measured.
  * intrinsic: can only be computed by the object being measured and only  by  analyzing  the  internal  algorithms  and  data
structures such as queues and connection tables.

* Dimensiones (ya sea de las medidas intrinsecas o extrinsdecas):
  1. the topological granularity that the metric applies to, namely end-point (including client and server side), link-level or end-to-end. 
  2. the layer in the protocol stack, starting at the bottom of the stack with packet-level metrics  and  moving  progressively  up  the  stack  to  flow-level (such as TCP) and aggregate-level and application-level metrics.

* Areas *:
  1. Characterizing  traffic:    
  2. Assessing attack impact:
  3. Assessing DDoS defense effectivenes:
