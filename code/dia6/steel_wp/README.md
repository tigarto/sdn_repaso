This is a workspace that you can use to run pre-created example scripts,
or to create your own scripts interacting with the SteelScript packages.

To collect examples run 'python collect_examples.py.' You can also overwrite
the examples you have already collected with the '--overwrite' option.

If no examples are found, that means there are no SteelScript packages
installed with /examples in their root directory, or /examples contains no
files.
